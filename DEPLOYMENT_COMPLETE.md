# Atlas Deployment — COMPLETE ✅

## Live URLs
- **Frontend**: https://atlas-panda-psi.vercel.app
- **Backend API**: https://atlas-api-pa3s.onrender.com
- **Database**: Supabase hosted (pooler connection)

## What Was Done

### 1. Backend Deployment (Render Free)
- Deployed to Render with slim Dockerfile (text-only PDF parsing, no torch/Docling)
- Connected to Supabase hosted database
- CORS configured for frontend origin
- Cold start: ~60s (service sleeps after 15min inactivity)
- Health check: `GET https://atlas-api-pa3s.onrender.com/api/health`

### 2. Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
- Deployed from `frontend/` directory
- Environment variables configured (API_URL with trailing slash)
- Auto-deploys on `main` branch pushes
- Responsive design works on mobile + desktop

### 3. Database Setup (Supabase Hosted)
- Schema loaded with pgvector extension
- Connection string: `postgresql://postgres.kkyofhbiqgkjfgyrqzxv:Ar%40081103mbhospital2019@aws-1-ap-northeast-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres`
- ⚠️ **SECURITY**: Password exposed in screenshots — rotate after demo!

### 4. UI/UX Redesign
All implemented and deployed:
- ✅ Collapsible sidebar (card background, localStorage persisted)
- ✅ Claude-style chat thread (user right/orange, assistant left/card, composer at bottom)
- ✅ Collapsible thinking trace (shows reasoning before answer)
- ✅ Multi-turn chat history (scrollable)
- ✅ Page headers stripped to title-only (removed eyebrows + descriptions)
- ✅ Removed "Ask Copilot" heading from empty state
- ✅ Removed confidence meter from chat (kept sources + contradictions)
- ✅ Documents page header trimmed

### 5. Bug Fixes
- ✅ **Stale-document bug**: Fixed pipeline to clear `document_parses` and `doc_extractions` when all connectors removed
- ✅ API trailing-slash normalization
- ✅ Database connection fail-fast + error logging

### 6. Demo Data Seeded
Ran `demo/seed_hosted.py` against live backend:
- **3 unified assets**: Feed pump P-101, Database server db-prod-02, Core switch sw-core-7
- **12 source records** across 5 connectors (Asset Register, CMMS, SCADA, Topology, Compliance)
- **33 edges** (18 physical, 15 operational)
- **2 review items** flagged
- Demonstrates:
  - Cross-industry resolution (manufacturing + IT)
  - Anomaly gating (benign log filtered out)
  - Single-asset RCA (pump bearing)
  - Multi-hop RCA (db → switch via depends_on)
  - Compliance (work orders + rules)

## Live System Verification
✅ All systems operational:
- Backend responding to health checks
- Frontend loads and displays seeded data
- Graph, workflows, chat, documents all functional
- Sidebar collapse + chat thread working as designed

## Important Notes

### Before Public Demo
1. **Wake the backend**: Hit `https://atlas-api-pa3s.onrender.com/api/health` ~60s before presenting (Render free sleeps after 15min)
2. **Rotate secrets**:
   - Supabase database password (currently: `Ar@081103mbhospital2019`)
   - `NVIDIA_API_KEY` (exposed in logs)
   - `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` (tracing key)

### Known Limitations
- **Cold starts**: First request after sleep takes ~60s
- **PDF parsing**: Text-only (no tables/images) on Render free
- **Rate limits**: NIM free tier = 40 req/min shared across all calls

### Repository
- GitHub: https://github.com/arnavbhatia2003/atlas-et-hackathon
- Latest commit: `2528ff3` (seed script + UI fixes)
- All changes pushed to `main`

## Demo Flow
1. Wake backend: `curl https://atlas-api-pa3s.onrender.com/api/health`
2. Open app: https://atlas-panda-psi.vercel.app
3. Show Home dashboard (3 assets, metrics)
4. Show Graph (visual network)
5. Show Workflows (RCA for pump, Compliance for db-prod-02)
6. Show Ask Copilot (natural language Q&A with chat thread)
7. Show collapsible sidebar + responsive mobile view

## Next Steps (If Needed)
- [ ] Rotate exposed credentials
- [ ] Add CI/CD tests
- [ ] Monitor Render logs for errors
- [ ] Consider upgrading to Render paid tier (no sleep, more RAM for full Docling)
