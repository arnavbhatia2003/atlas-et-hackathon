"""Persist the resolution projection into Postgres.

Design: `source_records` accumulate across connectors and syncs — they are the
durable ground truth and are NEVER wiped here. The unified assets, identifiers,
source-record links, physical graph edges, and (non-manual) review items are a
DERIVED projection of the canonical model, so they are rebuilt in full from the
resolution result on every sync. Operational edges (failures, work orders) are
left untouched.
