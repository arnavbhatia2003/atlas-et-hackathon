"""NVIDIA NIM chat models for the chatbot + RCA/compliance workflows.

Every chat model shares the one process-wide rate budget (``get_rate_limiter``)
so chat and embeddings together stay under the free-tier 40 rpm cap. NIM also
throttles opportunistically ("traffic from other users may cause throttling"),
so ``resilient()`` wraps calls with bounded exponential-backoff retries to absorb
transient 429s instead of failing the request.

Two tiers (see config / Tech Stack decision log):
  - ``get_chat_model()``      -> nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b (deep reasoning; MoE,
                                 ~1.9s TTFT). Used for RCA/compliance/ask answers.
  - ``get_fast_chat_model()`` -> nano-9b-v2 (cheap, high-frequency: intent routing).

All chat is streamed via SSE at the API layer, so perceived latency is
time-to-first-token, not full completion.
