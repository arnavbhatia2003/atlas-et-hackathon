"""Accumulative, incremental ingestion pipeline.

Records arrive from connectors (named sources). Ingest is:

  * INCREMENTAL — only records whose (system, record_id) is not already stored
    are added; re-syncing the same source adds nothing.
  * ACCUMULATIVE — after storing the new delta, the WHOLE corpus of stored
    source_records is re-resolved and the derived projection rebuilt. Syncing one
    source therefore never wipes another; the knowledge graph grows.

Only NEW records are embedded (the NVIDIA rate budget is respected); stored
embeddings are reused. Raw records are saved durably BEFORE the projection is
rebuilt, so a processing failure never loses the source (chain-of-custody).
