"""Chatbot router (LangGraph).

A controlled router — NOT a free-roaming ReAct agent — so every answer is
grounded and the number of LLM calls per turn is bounded:

    route -> { ask | asset_lookup | rca | compliance } -> END

- route:         deterministic keyword routing first; a single cheap nano-model
                 classification only when keywords are inconclusive.
- asset_lookup:  pure SQL, 0 LLM calls — canonical facts + graph neighborhood.
- ask:           grounded RAG. Retrieve (pgvector + optional resolved asset),
                 then ONE streamed answer that must cite retrieved sources.
                 Confidence + contradictions are derived deterministically, not
                 asked of the model.
- rca / compliance: delegate to the dedicated subgraphs, forwarding their
                 per-stage status events to the same SSE stream.

Answers always carry citations, a confidence value, and any contradicting
evidence explicitly (never dropped).
